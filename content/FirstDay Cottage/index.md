    title: Forms in place for foundation walls to be poured. Lots of stone under and around the footings for drainage.  The foundation was the only piece of the house that we did not build ourselves.

    title: Foam and plumbing in place ready for radiant tubes to be installed.  We have not hooked up the radiant tubes, but they're in place for possible future use to provide a heated basement.

    title: Radiant heating tubes stapled to the foam. Now the slab can be poured.

    title: Finally, the slab has been poured, with drain pipes protruding.

    title: A tarp tent I rigged up to protect some of the decking and sheathing that won't be used right away.

    title: Utility trench showing all the pipes that have to run 300 feet from the old house and septic tank up to the new house. There's septic drain pipe (the green stuff with the cleanout pipe), electrical (the big grey pipe), and smaller gray pipes for phone (and future cable or fiber, not yet available here).

    title: The new septic tank being lowered into place. We're running the outlet of this new tank downhill 300 feet to the old septic tank.

    title: Greenhouse with end walls removed, used as a workshop for building and stacking floor beams.
  - src: P6090685.JPG
    title: Beams for the one-story section partially installed.
  - src: P6110701.JPG
    title: Five beams for the two-story section have ends that didn't rest on a foundation wall, so we had to construct posts to support those ends.
  - src: P6160710.JPG
    title: "Decking for first floor of two story section nearly complete, with hole for basement stairs. Note the BoWrench on the right."

    title: Foundation partially backfilled with stone. Still visible are the fiberglass drainage board and perimeter pipes.
  - src: P6200727.JPG
    title: Complicated joint for the various drainage pipes. It took about an hour to put this together.
  - src: P7050741.JPG
    title: The "goalposts" for two story section in place.
  - src: P7200760.JPG
    title: Rafters for the second floor installed and braced. Note the evergreen branch for good luck.
  - src: P7300776.JPG
    title: Sheathing the two story wall with 1x8 tongue and groove pine.  This is the wall facing the future one story section.  The first one story post/rafter assembly will be nailed directly to this wall, after which we will cut out the unnecessary parts of the sheathing.

    title: Another view of the one story rafters, with the wall sheathing partially installed.
  - src: IMG_20120830_083536.jpg
    title: "The one story section partially roofed.  From top down, you can see the first four layers: sheathing, Typar, foam, and strapping.  The next step is installing the metal roofing, which hasn't arrived yet.  The two story section is also waiting for metal roofing."
  - src: P9190857.JPG
    title: The bucket loader on our neighbor's excavator turned out to be the perfect platform for installing the windows upstairs.
  - src: P9220875.JPG
    title: Rented scaffolds made it much easier to install the metal roofing on the two story section.
  - src: IMG_20121025_074336.jpg
    title: The first siding boards are up.  It's slow going because of the need to custom cut boards to fit around windows.  We stained the boards on both sides before nailing them up.
  - src: IMG_20121025_074420.jpg
    title: We chose to use prefabricated staircases instead of making them ourselves.  They were very heavy and required four people to lift into place, but they look good and saved a lot of work overall.
  - src: IMG_20121025_074527.jpg
    title: The four doors were fairly straightforward to install, but each one took about 2.5 hours to get shimmed and screwed into place.  Here you can see the pressure treated blocking I placed below the front door to support it.
  - src: IMG_20121106_080355.jpg
    title: Putting up the siding over the one story roof was very difficult and took two days.  The piece at the very peak, barely visible in the picture, was the worst; we should have glued it in place instead of trying to nail it.
  - src: IMG_20121114_125654.jpg
    title: We decided to make our own wood stove hearth pad instead of buying one for $600.  We had to learn about laying tile (with the help of a book) but it came out looking good, and has an unusual, organic shape.
  - src: IMG_20121114_125719.jpg
    title: The prefab staircase between the first and second floors.  Eventually there will be a wall around the opening with a door to the basement stairs.
  - src: IMG_20121210_093725.jpg
    title: We're planning on covering the corners of the house with trim made from siding boards ripped in half and beveled at 30 degrees on one side.  One board will need to have its tongue deepened to fit over the other board. The picture shows a test mockup of the trim profile.
  - src: IMG_20121210_093801.jpg
    title: We finally finished the siding yesterday, after six weeks of working weekday mornings and weekends, and just before a spell of bad weather.  The last side we did was the east face of the one story section.  Its five windows, two doors, and triangular top made for complicated cut patterns.
  - src: IMG_20121212_084418.jpg
    title: Here's the same view of the newly completed exterior as the previous photo, but taken the next morning when the sun was out.  This shows how the stain we mixed from two colors (a cedar and a beige) has a nice glow to it.

    title: Our first attempt at interior framing was the wall around the basement stairs.  We chose to hide the studs inside the opening, which required some tricky cuts at the bottom of the studs where they meet the stairs.
  - src: IMG_20130203_140813.jpg
    title: The rest of the interior framing has proceeded fairly quickly.  The picture shows parts of the walls for the basement stairs, the bathroom, and the bedroom.  We chose to use screws instead of nails to attach the studs to the floor and beams; the studs don't move using this method.
  - src: IMG_20130228_153906.jpg
    title: The rental drum sander we used for the first step in sanding the floors.  We tried other non-drum sanders but they failed miserably.
  - src: IMG_20130321_090334.jpg
    title: There was so much dust left over from final stage of floor sanding that flies left highly visible tracks.
  - src: IMG_20130321_091710.jpg
    title: Installing the chimney pipe was one step we hired out but should have done ourselves.  The pipe leaks when snow piles up and then melts on warm days.  Eventually we may have to replace the flashing with a high-temp silicone boot.
  - src: IMG_20130324_155737.jpg
    title: We didn't sand the floor sections that will be under the kitchen cabinets, and the difference is obvious.
  - src: IMG_20130513_113750.jpg
    title: The Vermont PolyWhey (whey-based polyurethane) we've applied to the floors has a satin finish, but is still slightly shiny.
  - src: IMG_20130513_113933.jpg
    title: We're also applying PolyWhey to the pine boards we're going to be using to make window sills and trim.  It'll be less messy to do this before they're nailed in place.
  - src: IMG_20130622_182908.jpg
    title: Closer view of window sill trim.  The design is very simple because we had 35 windows to do.

    title: The components making up the transition from Wiremold raceway in the first floor to the Romex cable in the basement.
  - src: IMG_20130623_132749.jpg
    title: The hole bringing wires up from the basement is covered by a Wiremold connector.
  - src: IMG_20130624_084134.jpg
    title: In the basement, the incoming Romex wires mate to outgoing THHN wires in a junction box, which then run up into the house through a flexible water-tight conduit.

    title: False wall for electrical outlets in pantry, the lower part of which will be hidden behind a counter.
  - src: IMG_2924.JPG
    title: We used low-voltage track lighting by Tech Lighting in the kitchen (shown here) and in the upstairs work area.
  - src: IMG_2925.JPG
    title: "Two of the kitchen track lights are dragonflies: not a lot of light, but a lot of whimsy."
  - src: IMG_2926.JPG
    title: Three of the kitchen track lights are metal men holding 50 watt MR-16 bulbs.  These are bright enough to cover most of the kitchen counter.
  - src: IMG_2927.JPG
    title: The ceiling lamps in the kitchen are powered by wires running in Wiremold metal raceways running up the posts and rafters.
  - src: IMG_2931.JPG
    title: The radon pipe enters the basement slab through an opening that was originally meant for a shower drain, and rests on the gravel beneath the slab.
  - src: IMG_2932.JPG
    title: The radon pipe runs along the basement ceiling for about 40 feet.
  - src: IMG_2933.JPG
    title: The radon pipe exits the basement through a hole above the door.
  - src: IMG_2935.JPG
    title: The radon fan is mounted outside the house, just above the walkout basement door.
  - src: IMG_2934.JPG
    title: The radon pipe terminates with a rain cap 12 inches above the roof.

    title: The piano room seen from the west end.
  - src: IMG_2947.JPG
    title: View towards the bedroom from the east end of the piano room, showing how we tried to keep the house open with long sight lines.
  - src: IMG_2952.JPG
    title: Bathtub in downstairs bathroom.  We didn't try to hide the plumbing leading to the upstairs half-bath; eventually we may paint the pipes, rather than try to hide them behind wooden boxes.
  - src: IMG_2953.JPG
    title: Downstairs bathroom sink, with electrical and plumbing hidden behind an angled false wall.
  - src: IMG_2955.JPG
    title: We kept the hallway leading to the bedroom wide enough for a work area.
  - src: IMG_2964.JPG
    title: View of the one story section (living room, kitchen, dining room) from the two story section.
  - src: IMG_2965.JPG
    title: The living room is simply a cluster of seats around the wood stove.
  - src: IMG_2967.JPG
    title: The dining nook against the east wall, with the pantry on the north side.  The east wall is topped with a stained glass window made by a good friend.
  - src: IMG_2968.JPG
    title: The pantry on the northeast corner of the one story section.
  - src: IMG_2975.JPG
    title: Stairs with railings made from ash and maple saplings cut on our woodlot.
  - src: IMG_2976.JPG
    title: The downstairs bedroom has windows on three sides, making for a kind of screened-in sleeping porch in summer.

    title: The larger room upstairs, used for fabric arts and crafts.

Here are photographs taken during the building of a [FirstDay Cottage](http://www.firstdaycottage.com/).
For posts about the building process, start [here](https://www.bloovis.com/posts/2012-05-11-firstday-cottage-under-way/).

This house was 1550 square feet, and consisted of a one-story section measuring 15x30 feet,
and a two-story section measuring 15x37 feet.  The two sections were joined together
in a T shape.

The build was done by two persons working nearly full time for 1.5 years, starting
in May 2012 and finishing in September 2013.  The project had two phases.
The first phase was the "dried in" weather proof shell.  This was completed
by the first week in December 2012.  We did most of this phase ourselves,
with some help from friends at various times. The parts we did not do ourselves were:
full foundation with basement; installation of the septic tank; and bringing in electricity from the street to the panel in the basement

The second phase was the interior work, which took another 10 months.
We split the projects between us.  I did the plumbing and electrical
work, and the installation of interior walls and doors. My partner did
the rest of the interior work, including kitchen counters,
tile-covered kitchen island, pantry, tiled woodstove hearth, hand-made
railings, and much else.  The parts we did not do ourselves were:
installation of wood stove chimney pipe; and polyurethane floor finish.

Over the course of the  next couple of years, we installed porches off
of the front door and kitchen door, and a radon mitigation system.

I feel this project was the best and most satisyfing work of my life,
far more so than any paid software project.  Unfortunately, I no
longer live in this house.  I would like to build another, much
smaller house someday, but I'm not sure this will happen, give my
advancing age, the lack of a partner, and the the huge increase in
construction material prices in recent years.
