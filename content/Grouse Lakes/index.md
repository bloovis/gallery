    title: "Penner Lake.  This is a very popular site for backpackers, so I didn't camp here.  But the water was fine for a refreshing swim."

    title: "Long Lake.  This is a small lake off the main trail that I found by accident on my only backpack trip in 2024.  It was deserted, so I camped here instead of trying to find my way back to my original destination."

    title: "There's a longer trail to Upper Rock Lake from Loney Meadow that traverses around Bowman Mountain.  From the high point there are some long views to the north.  Below is Bowman Lake,  a large reservoir that is reached by a rough jeep road.  I'll probably not try to visit the lake; it doesn't look like a good camping spot, due to the jeeps and artificial shoreline."

    title: "When autumn returned, it wasn't nearly as colorful as my former home of Vermont.  The aspens turned yellow, instead of red or gold."

    title: "I visited Upper Rock Lake in November, after a light snowfall.  The water level was very low.  To take this picture, I was standing where the water would have reached back in June."

A lake-filled region of the Sierra in Nevada County. I started visiting this area on a weekly basis after moving to the Sierra foothills in May 2024.
